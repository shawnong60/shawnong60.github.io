            <p>We are using a token system this semester for revisions. Here are some frequently asked questions about tokens.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: How can I earn a token?</strong></p>

            <p>A: Attend an approved event. Upcoming events will be announced at the beginning of each class period. Then email the instructor (see next question).</p>

            <p><strong>Q: I attended an approved event. How do I get my token?</strong></p>

            <p>A: Send me an email within 24 hours of your attendance. Use the subject line [341-XX Token] where you replace XX with either 01 or 02 for your section number. In the body of your email include the following information:

            <ul>
                <li>A brief description of the event that you attended. (Such as: date of event, title of presentation if relevant, classmate you supported if relevant).</li>
                <li>Was the event an academic activity or a peer support activity?</li>
                <li>(If academic) Give a brief (3-5 sentence) explanation of the event, or comment on some things you learned.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Q: I attended something that wasn’t listed during class, and I think it should count.</strong></p>

            <p>A: The very best thing to do is to always bring up your suggested events during class before it occurs to get approval. You can ask me about it after the event, but know that since there are so many eligible opportunitites I present during class, I am less inclined to approve things after the fact.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I participate in an extra credit opporunity before I need any resubmissions?</strong></p>

            <p>A: Yes, participate in up to six activities at any time, and cash in on your tokens as you need them.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I “use” a token before I’ve earned it? Can I submit a revision before earning a token?</strong></p>

            <p>A: Yes, participate in up to six activities at any time, and cash in on your tokens as you need them. At the end of the semester if you haven’t earned enough tokens, your grade will be adjusted appropriately.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: If I earn a token, do I need to complete a resubmission within a particular time frame?</strong></p>

            <p>A: No, participate in up to six activities at any time, and cash in on your tokens as you need them.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: When are revisions due?</strong></p>

            <p>A: If you would like to use a token, the only hard deadline is 5pm on the last day of finals. However, you are only allowed to submit at most 2 resubmissions in any given week (Sunday – Saturday), so you will need to plan to complete some things before the last week of the semester. Additionally, some later homework assignments may not be graded fast enough for there to be time for a resubmission.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: What if I resubmit a homework, and I still don’t get full credit. May I resubmit it again?</strong></p>

            <p>A: You may, by using another token.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: May I use a token for homework that I didn’t turn in?</strong></p>

            <p>A: You may not. This system is meant to encourage you to take a second look at concepts that you may have struggled with initially, not as a way to turn in things late. Homework problems in particular must show a good faith effort initally in order to be resubmitted.</p>

            <p><strong>Q: Can I resubmit multiple problems on the same exam?</strong></p>

            <p>A: You may only use up to one token on each exam.</p>
